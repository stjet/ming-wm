The goal of the game is to reveal all tiles that are not mines. Revealing a tile that is a mine means game over.

The game consists of revealing tiles. If a revealed tile has no mines directly adjacent to it (above, below, left, right, top left, top right, etc). All tiles adjacent to it are revealed. If any of the newly revealed tiles have no mines directly adjacent to it, then... well you get the point.

Tiles with mines adjacent to it are labeled with a number stating how many mines are adjacent to it.

To start the game, first enter in a seed for the game, by typing in four random characters, then hitting enter. Then, choose the first tile to reveal. That first tile is guaranteed to be a non-mine tile with no mines adjacent to it.

Games with the same seed and first tile revealed will have the same mine layout, making the game suitable for competition.

Choosing to reveal a tile is simple. Just type in the two character name of that tile. For example, 'c4' or '15'. If you make a mistake with the first character, just use the backspace/delete key to clear.

Upon winning or losing, press a key to play again.
