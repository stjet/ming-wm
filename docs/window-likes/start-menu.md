The start menu, which can be opened and closed with the [Alt+s shortcut](../system/shortcuts.md).

## Navigation

Use the 'j' and 'k' keys to move down and up respectively. The up and down arrow keys can also be used. Going down past the last option returns the selection to the first option, and vice versa (it loops).

Hitting the 'enter' key will either open a subfolder containing window-likes, if a category is selected, or the corresponding window-like, if a window-like is selected. It may also exit a subfolder and return to the category selection if "Back" is selected and 'enter' is hit. There is another special case: hitting 'enter' while the "Logout" option is selected will, as the name implies, logout and return to the lock screen (this does not log out of the Linux user!).

For faster navigation, hitting any lower-case letter (besides 'j' and 'k') will move the selection to the next option that starts with that letter (non-looping). For example, when first opening the start menu, hitting 'e' will move the selection to "Editing". Hitting any upper-case letter will move the selection to any previous option that starts with that letter (also non-looping). For example, when initially opening the start menu, the selected option is "About". After hitting 'j' (moving down), hitting 'A' will return the selection to "About".
